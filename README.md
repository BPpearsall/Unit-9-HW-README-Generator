# Professional README Generator:

## Description

For this homework we were tasked with creating a professional README generator through node and inquirer. 

I have made my index.js node create a generatedREADME.md file with a title, description, functional table of contents, installation guidelines, usage information, responsive license badges and links, contribution guidelines, testing instructions, and an area for questions linked to my github and email

When I complete the questions in the terminal, it populates the correct area in the generatedREADME.

When I complete the inquirer, it runs a linked JS file called generateMarkdown.js which houses the skeleton .md file and adds the linked answers to the approriate area.
